<h3 align="left">About me</h3>

>9 weeks to change my life and get into the tech sector...
That was the challenge I undertook in early 2024 by joining the Wagon's Data Analytics bootcamp.
With over 15 years of work experience and an exciting entrepreneurial journey, I wasn't entirely new to IT world. 
I had already learned to manipulate and derive insights from data.
This training provided me with the necessary technical skills to thrive as a Data Analyst.
The world of tech is particularly stimulating: it offers constant learning, challenges, adaptability, and growth opportunities.
It perfectly aligns with the mindset that has always driven me: determination, open-mindedness, and perseverance.

Data is an underexplored playground. <br>
